Having received Hanuman’s report on Sita Rama and Lakshmana proceed with their allies towards the shore of the southern sea. There they are joined by Ravana’s renegade brother Vibhishana. The apes named Nala and Nila construct a floating bridge across the sea using stones that floated on water because they had Rama name written on them. The princes and their army cross over to Lanka.
