On reuniting with Rama after the battle of lanka, Sita undergoes an Agni Pariksha (test of fire) to prove her chastity to rid herself of the rumors surrounding her purity. When Sita plunges into the sacrificial fire Agni lord of fire raises Sita unharmed to the throne attesting to her innocence. In Tulsidas Rama charitamanas Sita was under the protection of Agni so it was necessary to bring her out before reuniting with Rama.
