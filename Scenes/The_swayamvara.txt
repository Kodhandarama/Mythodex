Janaka the king of Mithila decided to hold a swayamvara for his daughter Sita. The king had decided that whoever could lift and wield the heavy bow presented to his ancestors by Shiva could marry Sita. Sage Vishwamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to Mithila to show the bow. Then Rama desires to lift it and goes on to wield the bow and when he draws the string it breaks. Marriages are arranged between the sons of Dasharatha and daughters of Janaka. Rama gets married to Sita. Lakshmana to Urmila.  Bharatha to Mandavi. Shatrughna to Shrutakirti. The weddings are celebrated with great festivity in Mithila and the marriage party returns to Ayodhya.
