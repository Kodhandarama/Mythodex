Hanuman flies to Lanka in search of Rama’s wife Sita. Hanuman locates Sita in Ashoka grove where she is being wooed and threatened by Ravana and his rakshasis to marry Ravana. Hanuman reassures Sita giving Rama’s signet ring as a sign of good faith. He offers to carry Sita back to Rama; however she refuses and says that it is not the dharma stating that Ramayana will not have significance if Hanuman carries her to Rama – "When Rama is not there Ravana carried Sita forcibly and when Ravana was not there Hanuman carried Sita back to Rama". She says that Rama himself must come and avenge the insult of her abduction.
