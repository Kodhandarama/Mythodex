After Rama goes to hunt the deer Sita hears him calling out to her; afraid for his life she insists that Lakshmana rush to his aid. Lakshmana tries to assure her that Rama is invincible and that it is best if he continues to follow Rama orders to protect her. On the verge of hysterics Sita insists that it is not she but Rama who needs Lakshmana help. He obeys her wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any stranger. He draws a chalk outline the Lakshmana rekha around the cottage and casts a spell on it that prevents anyone from entering the boundary but allows people to exit.
