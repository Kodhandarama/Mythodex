Learning of his brother's exile, Bharatha becomes furious with his mother and promises to bring him back to Ayodhya. When Bharatha reached the forest, Rama calmly rejects his brother's plea and makes him understand that it is his duty to carry out the queen's order. Devastated, Bharatha asks Rama for his wooden sandals so that they may be placed at the seat of the throne so that Bharata can look after the kingdom on his behalf.
