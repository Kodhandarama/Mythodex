Valmiki took Sita in as an ashram inmate when he was banished where she gave birth to her twin sons named Lava and Kusha whom Valmiki brought up with great love and affection teaching them princely skills such as archery as well as scholarly skills such as the Vedas and other scriptures. Valmiki also taught them to sing the Ramayana which he had finished composing by this time. The twins who were unaware of their parentage and hence unaware that they were singing about their own family would recite the poem at gatherings. They became so well-loved for their sweet recitation that their fame reached Rama ears who summoned them for a performance. It was here at Rama court that the true story was revealed to the twins: that they spitting images of the king were his sons and that their mother was none other than the Sita whom they sang of.
