Dasharatha the king of Ayodhya had no children. So he arranged a Putra-kameshti sacrifice. At the sacrifice the god of fire arose from the flames and handed the king a golden vase brimming with nectar. "Give this to your queens" said the god and disappeared. The king had three wives Kaushalya Kaikeyi and Sumitra. To the eldest the king gave half of the nectar; the second queen got a portion that remained when the queen had drunk her half. To the youngest queen the king gave the remaining half of the nectar and again the second queen got the portion that remained. In time the queens gave birth to sons: to the eldest was born Rama to the youngest was born Bharatha and to the second queen were born the twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna.
